AutoValue: Firebase Extension
========

For value classes to be compatible with [Firebase Realtime Database], they must:

- contain public "get"-prefixed accessors *or* public fields, and
- contain an empty, or "default," constructor.

If we want to use [AutoValue], the first requirement is achievable -- we can prefix getters with "get" -- though many among us may prefer to name our getters without the "get" prefix.

The second requirement is impossible -- `AutoValue` simply doesn't generate default constructors.

This library is an `AutoValue` extension for generating `Firebase Realtime Database` compatible value classes with easy conversions between your `AutoValue` and `FirebaseValue` instances.

Usage
-----

Just add `auto-value-firebase` to your project and add the `@FirebaseValue` annotation to your existing `@AutoValue` annotated classes.

This extension creates `Firebase Realtime Database` compatible static inner classes, each named `FirebaseValue`, inside your generated `AutoValue` classes. From there, it's easy to convert your `AutoValue` object to a `FirebaseValue` object.

### Example

Here's a simple `AutoValue` class called `Taco`:

```java
@AutoValue
public abstract class Taco {

  public static Taco create(String name, List<Ingredient> ingredients, Review review) {
    return new AutoValue_Taco(name, ingredients, review);
  }

  public abstract String name();

  public abstract List<Ingredient> ingredients();

  public abstract Review review();
}
```

From here, we just add the `@FirebaseValue` annotation. This generates our `FirebaseValue` class as a static inner class of `AutoValue_Taco`.

```java
@AutoValue @FirebaseValue
public abstract class Taco {

  public static Taco create(String name, List<Ingredient> ingredients, Review review) {
    return new AutoValue_Taco(name, ingredients, review);
  }

  public static Taco create(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {
    return dataSnapshot.getValue(AutoValue_Taco.FirebaseValue.class).toAutoValue();
  }

  public Object toFirebaseValue() {
    return new AutoValue_Taco.FirebaseValue(this);
  }

  public abstract String name();

  public abstract List<Ingredient> ingredients();

  public abstract Review review();
}
```

In addition to the empty constructor required by `Firebase Realtime Database`, the generated `FirebaseValue` class includes a constructor that takes your `AutoValue` class as an argument. The generated `FirebaseValue` class also includes a `toAutoValue()` method to convert it back to the `AutoValue` instance.

The `create(DataSnapshot)` and `toFirebaseValue` methods aren't required, but this is how I'd recommend converting your `AutoValue` objects to and from their corresponding `FirebaseValue` objects.

### Collections

If you want to deserialize a collection of objects from a `DataSnapshot`, you can iterate through its children and convert each object from `FirebaseValue` to `AutoValue`. This method could be added to the `Taco` class above.

```java
public static Map<String, Taco> createMap(DataSnapshot snapshot) {
  Map<String, Taco> tacos = new HashMap<>();
  for (DataSnapshot child : snapshot.getChildren()) {
    tacos.put(child.getKey(), child.getValue(AutoValue_Taco.FirebaseValue.class).toAutoValue());
  }
  return tacos;
}
```

### TypeAdapters

Type adapters can be declared and used as follows:
```java
public class DateAdapter implements TypeAdapter<Date, Long> {
  @Override
  public Date fromFirebaseValue(Long value) {
    return new Date(value);
  }

  @Override
  public Long toFirebaseValue(Date value) {
    return value.getTime();
  }
}
```

```java
@AutoValue @FirebaseValue
public abstract class Review {

  public static Review create(String description, int rating, Date reviewDate) {
    return new AutoValue_Review(description, rating, reviewDate);
  }

  public abstract String description();

  public abstract int rating();

  @FirebaseAdapter(DateAdapter.class) public abstract Date dateOfReview();
}

```

Type adapters require a small runtime component which can be added to your gradle dependencies:

`compile 'me.mattlogan.auto.value.firebase:type-adapters:0.2.2'`


### Supported types

This extension can generate `FirebaseValue` classes that contain any types that `Firebase Realtime Database` supports as described in their [documentation] **except for nested collections**.

For example, `List<Ingredient>` is supported but `List<List<Ingredient>>` is not. This might come in a later release.

### Firebase annotations

`Firebase Realtime Database` provides four annotations to configure the mapping from your value classes to the cloud database and back. You can annotate your methods with `@Exclude` or `@PropertyName`, and you can annotate your classes with `@IgnoreExtraProperties` or `@ThrowOnExtraProperties`.

If you want these annotations to be included in your generated `FirebaseValue` class, just add them to your abstract `AutoValue` class.

### Naming

This extension uses the method names from your `AutoValue` class to generate the fields and getters on the generated `FirebaseValue` class.

As a result, it's required that you **don't** prefix your getters with `get`.


Download
--------

This extension should be included as an `apt` dependency (if you're using [android-apt]).

The `@FirebaseValue` annotation is packaged separately, and should be included as a `provided` dependency.

```groovy
apt 'me.mattlogan.auto.value:auto-value-firebase:0.2.2'
provided 'me.mattlogan.auto.value:auto-value-firebase-annotation:0.2.2'
```
